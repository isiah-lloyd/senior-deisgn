# Abstract

A Better Screenreader is an accessibility tool meant to make browsing the web quicker and easier for those with visual impairments. A Better Screenreader differs from normal screen reading software because it uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to pick out the important parts of web pages rather than superfluous information that someone with visual impairments shouldn’t need to worry about. 
A Better Screenreader is built to work with websites that don’t conform to accessibility standards in order to make the web more accessible to all.
