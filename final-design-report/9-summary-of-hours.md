#### Justification:  
During the fall semester, I participated in our team meetings. Outside of the meetings I researched various machine learning technology that may be applicable to our project and worked on proof of concepts.  In the spring semester, I participated in team meetings.  I worked on developing the dataset we would use for training and the tools that we used to process raw data into a usable dataset.  I worked on the machine learning service gateway, which allowed our finished machine learning model to communicate with the other components of our project.  I also worked on developing, training, and testing our machine learning model.

#### Justification
A majority of my time was spent acting as the project manager, which included scheduling weekly meetings with the team, scheduling biweekly meetings with our advisor, sending out reminders for each meeting, keeping detailed meeting notes and keeping track of action items. My other major contribution to the project was that of user interface designer. I focused a lot of the branding of BetterRead â€“ coming up with the name, the color scheme, and how we wanted to bring together both vision impaired and seeing communities. Another one of my responsibilities was to design the poster. I planned out the position, font, and color scheme of the different sections, put together charts, and collected feedback from teammates and advisor. I learned new programs like Adobe Illustrator to create the logo and Adobe Photoshop to create the poster, which took a good chunk of time to learn.
