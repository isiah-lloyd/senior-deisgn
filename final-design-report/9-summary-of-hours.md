## Team Member Hours Worked
### Will Cupp  
#### Spring
Team meetings: 28 hours  
Research: 15-20 hours  
Semester total: 43-48 hours  
#### Fall  
Team meetings: 19 hours  
Dataset and Data Processing Tools: 25 hours  
Machine Learning Service Gateway: 8 hours  
Machine Learning Model: 35 hours  
Semester total: 87 hours  
  
Year total:  130-135  
#### Justification
During the fall semester, I participated in our team meetings. Outside of the meetings I researched various machine learning technology that may be applicable to our project and worked on proof of concepts.  In the spring semester, I participated in team meetings.  I worked on developing the dataset we would use for training and the tools that we used to process raw data into a usable dataset.  I worked on the machine learning service gateway, which allowed our finished machine learning model to communicate with the other components of our project.  I also worked on developing, training, and testing our machine learning model.

### Maddie Eckhart
#### Spring
Team meetings: 28 hours  
Research: 15-20 hours  
Semester total: 43-48 hours  
#### Fall  
Team meetings: 19 hours  
Poster: 10 hours  
UI Design: 8 hours  
Project management (meetings, action items, advisor communication): 8 hours  
Web Extension: 5 hours  
Semester total: 50 hours  
  
Year total:  93-98  
#### Justification
A majority of my time was spent acting as the project manager, which included scheduling weekly meetings with the team, scheduling biweekly meetings with our advisor, sending out reminders for each meeting, keeping detailed meeting notes and keeping track of action items. My other major contribution to the project was that of user interface designer. I focused a lot of the branding of BetterRead – coming up with the name, the color scheme, and how we wanted to bring together both vision impaired and seeing communities. Another one of my responsibilities was to design the poster. I planned out the position, font, and color scheme of the different sections, put together charts, and collected feedback from teammates and advisor. I learned new programs like Adobe Illustrator to create the logo and Adobe Photoshop to create the poster, which took a good chunk of time to learn.

### Isiah Lloyd
#### Spring
Team meetings: 28 hours  
Research: 15-20 hours  
Semester total: 43-48 hours  
#### Fall  
Team meetings: 19 hours  
Web Extension: 25 hours  
Web scraper: 10 hours  
Semester total: 54 hours  
  
Year total:  97-102  
#### Justification

The fall semester was spent doing research and team organzation/meetings before we started work in the spring. I spent a majority of my time working on my main duty on this team, which was the web extension. I already knew the basics of developing one so not a lot of time was spent on learning, but developing and working on features that were outside the scope of our orignal plan but a big positive to our extension, such as cloud synced user options. I also spent time developing a web scraper for the machine learning team. I had never done this before so it took time researching how to do it as well as getting my machine setup using Selenium and actually runing the scrapper took quite a lot of time as well. The Spring semester also included meetings with our faculity advisor and team as well as working on our assignments and presentation.

### Sean Hearne
#### Spring
Team meetings: 28 hours  
Research: 15-20 hours  
Semester total: 43-48 hours  
#### Fall  
Team meetings: 19 hours  
Trainning Data Creation: 5 hours  
Data Processing: 8 hours  
REST API Development: 30 hours  
Semester total: 62 hours  
  
Year total:  105-110 hours
#### Justification

The majority of my hours on this project were spent working on the REST API. Since I have had no experience in starting REST API from scratch a lot of this time was spent learning the framework. After learning the framework I was able to use code I had created working with Will Cupp for data processing. The training data creation was data we processed from Isiah’s web scraper being formatted to create a machine learning model.
