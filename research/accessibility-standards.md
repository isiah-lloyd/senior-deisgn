# Current Accessibility Standards

## W3C Accessibility Standards
- Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services
- The [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/article-9-accessibility.html) recognizes access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, as a **basic human right**.
- Case studies show that accessible websites have better search results, reduced maintenance costs, and increased audience reach, among other benefits.

### Transcripts for Audio
- Providing a text transcript makes the audio information accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as to search engines and other technologies that can't hear
- It's easy and relatively inexpensive for websites to provide transcripts
  - There are also transcription services that create text transcripts in HTML format.

### Functionality is available from a keyboard
- Many people do not use the mouse and rely on the keyboard to interact with the Web. This requires keyboard access to all functionality, including form controls, input, and other user interface components.
- All functionality that is available by mouse is also available by keyboard
- Keyboard focus does not get trapped in any part of the content
- Web browsers, authoring tools, and other tools provide keyboard support
- Meeting this requirement helps keyboard users, including people using alternative keyboards such as keyboards with ergonomic layouts, on-screen keyboards, or switch devices. It also helps people using voice recognition (speech input) to operate websites and to dictate text through the keyboard interface.

### Users can easily navigate, find content, and determine where they are
- Pages have clear titles and are organized using descriptive section headings
- There is more than one way to find relevant pages within a set of web pages
- Users are informed about their current location within a set of related pages
- There are ways to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple pages
- The keyboard focus is visible, and the focus order follows a meaningful sequence
- The purpose of a link is evident, ideally even when the link is viewed on its own

### Users have enough time to read and use the content
- Some people need more time than others to read and use the content. For instance, some people require more time to type text, understand instructions, operate controls, or to otherwise complete tasks on a website.
- Stop, extend, or adjust time limits, except where necessary
- Pause, stop, or hide moving, blinking, or scrolling content
- Postpone or suppress interruptions, except where necessary
- Re-authenticate when a session expires without losing data
